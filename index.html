<h4 style="color: white;"> The object of the game is to move all the disks over to Tower 3 (with your mouse). But you cannot place a larger disk onto a smaller disk. </h4>
    <p style="color: white;"> You can use the application by pressing the Make Move button. The first press will load the Hanoi Tower. Every button press after that iterates through solving the Hanoi Tower. When the Hanoi Tower is solved, on the last button press, you will receive an alert stating Tower is Finished.</p>
  <p style="color: white;"> In the text field below, enter the number of disks you want to use. If you enter nothing, the tower will start with 5 disks by default </p>
